        <h2>Ecology</h2>

            <p>Tassalyr is situated in a cold region of Catonor, where its beautiful pine forests are blanketed by snow a substantial portion of the year. while the southern end of Tassalyr remains relatively mild in temperature, The lands turn to an icy tundra as the nation stretches northward to the Dominion of Frost, and a number of mountain ranges dot the country throughout. Camais is built partly into one such mountain range, taking advantage of abundant natural resources to build Tassalyr's capital and provide a natural defensive wall.</p>

        <h2>Origin</h2>

            <p>The history of Tassalyr stretches back a thousand years, to a time when three elven tribes roamed the varied landscape of what would later become the Kingdom. The elves were attuned to nature and enjoyed abundant sources of food nearby a great lake, and their early society was built on a deep respect for the land. <br><br>
            Legends speak of a visionary who united the tribes under a single banner; the first monarch Queen Aeloria. Previously a leader of one of the three tribes, Aeloria saw the explosive growth of the southern territories and feared their way of life could be swallowed by their expansion. To prevent their lands from shrinking, Aeloria declared herself queen, laying the foundations for the newborn kingdom of Tassalyr.<br><br>
            The remaining tribes admired her audacity and strength, electing to combine their people with hers and embrace Aeloria as the single rightful ruler of Tassalyr.</p>

                            Under Queen Aeloria, Tassalyr entered its Golden Age. The kingdom's cities were built and florished, and its culture of art and music reached unparalleled heights. Elven architects constructed magnificent palaces and temples, seamlessly blending natural elements with intricate craftsmanship. The capital city, Camais, became a beacon of enlightenment and beauty, known far and wide for its stone and wood architecture, precious crystal structures and lush gardens. While magic existed, it was rare and only a lucky few are able to wield it, but it's wonders have been woven into the city nonetheless.<br><br>
                            During the nation's golden age and assisted by it's neighbouring country Saldaer, Archeologists uncovered a number of peculiar stone structures all over the continent. Ruins of grand and beautiful archways dot the landscape, similar in design to the architecture of Tassalyr, making their Elven origin apparent. These ruined arches were reminiscent of doorways, and so came to be known as "Aiudara" in Elvish, meaning "Elf Gate."</p>

                            In the aftermath of Queen Aeloria's untimely death, Tassalyr's peaceful reign was shattered by a devastating civil war, which briefly tore apart the monarchy. Elven separatists, seeing the nomadic time of the elves before Queen Aeloria as a superior existence, rose against the established order. The conflict was brutal and left deep scars on the kingdom.<br><br>
                            The elves still loyal to the throne valiantly defended the unity of Tassalyr alongside assistance from Saldaer, and eventually, the monarchy was restored and the late queen's daughter Elaria took the throne. However, the aftermath of the civil war brought about a period of rebuilding and reflection, as the kingdom sought to heal from the internal strife.</p>

                            In the modern era, Tassalyr stands as a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of its people. The monarchy, now led by Queen Eris, has embraced both tradition and progress. The kingdom continues to thrive, with its cities buzzing with life and its culture as vibrant as ever. Tassalyr remains a land of quiet beauty, where magic is subtly woven into the fabric of existence, and the legacy of its late ruler endures.<br><br>
                            However, the tense relationship with the Dominion of Frost and its enigmatic dragon ruler remains a constant undercurrent, influencing diplomatic decisions and shaping the kingdom's northern defenses. Meanwhile, the nation maintains its cautious distance from Alormyr, prioritizing peace and stability.<br><br>
                            Seperatist activity is now very uncommon. Those who cling to the life of a nomad are few in number, and pose little threat to the stability of the crown.</p>

        <h2>The Last Holy War</h2>

            <p>Optimistically named as such to discourage any future conflicts, the Last Holy War was instigated by the western nation of Alormyr.  The ruthless theocracy viewed Saldaer's apparent lack of faith in the gods as potential for evil to cultivate, and Alormyr saw it as their divine right to conquer Saldaer and bring the Light of the Sword to the Eastern nation.<br><br>
            Saldaer and Tassalyr joined forces to defend the freedom of their nations, eventually bringing Alormyr's expansion to a halt just before the Dry Sea, and bringing an end to the war in a legendary victory.<br><br>
            The victory came with a heavy cost, however. A famed councillor of Saldaer and Queen Aeloria of Tassalyr had been found dead in each other's arms. Long rumoured to have a secret relationship, their bond was tragically confirmed at the very end of their lives.<br><br>
            To commemorate the late rulers of the two nations, The inlet where Ashonde makes its home, and where the two nations join borders, was named "Lover's Quay."

                        The elves of Tassalyr established strong trade relations with Saldaer, exchanging their high quality stone and precious crystals for exotic spices, textiles, and precious metals. This strong bond between the two nations is further solidified by a tale of love between rulers.<br><br>
                        According to the tale, the Queen of Tassalyr and a famed councillor of Saldaer fell in love and tragically died in each other's arms during the Last Holy War, who was attempting to spread compulsory worship of their deity by force. The tale of their love and sacrifice has been passed down through generations, fostering a deep sense of mutual respect and cooperation. </p>

                        The relationship between Tassalyr and the Dominion of Frost has always been tense, primarily due to the refusal of trade and the Dominion's refusal to lend aid during a devastating civil war in Tassalyr. The cold and snowy climate of Tassalyr, which becomes increasingly harsh and inhospitable as one travels north, only heightened the tensions. No love is lost between these two nations, and attempts by Tassalyr to communicate with the Dominion have only been met with silence.

                        Tassalyr avoids interaction with Alormyr whenever possible due to previous tension between the two nations. The elves of Tassalyr view Alormyr's rigid theocracy with suspicion and caution, preferring to maintain their distance and focus on more open and cooperative relationships.

        <h2>Faith</h2>

        <p>While Tassalyr asserts that any single citizen is free to worship as they please, the large majority of the populace find comfort in the stars and the deity who resides amongst them. It is theorised that a deep respect for the Bright Mother arose due to the use of constellations to assist the Elven tribes in their travels.</p>
