        <h2>Ecology</h2>

            <p>Saldaer is situated in central Catonor, the large majority of its land filled with verdant forests and vast grassy plains.  It enjoys pleasant weather most of the year, making it's fields perfect for cultivation of many different kinds of produce and spices.<br><br>
            As one travels northeast towards Tassalyr, the climate and landscape matches more closely with it's sister nation, turning to cold weather and minor snowfall during the cold months.<br><br>
            A vast desert makes its home to the West of Nashonde named The Dry Sea. Thought to once be a great lake, it is now a barren expanse of cracked earth and dunes. Travellers hoping to gain passage to Alormyr tend to circle around the Sea and stick to more pallatable routes to avoid the dangers that come with a journey through the desert, however Archeologists from Ashonde will often travel there to search for artifacts and evidence of what the Sea once was.

        <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>The nation of Saldaer is a thriving mercantile nation who used the central location of their home to cement themselves as a giant in the world of trade. A thousand years ago, Saldaer was a spatttering of individual territories governed by their respective rulers, who found central Catonor to be filled to the brim with exotic spices, materials, and a varied climate allowing the cultivation of countless crops.<br><br>
            Seeing the potential to dominate the continent through trade, these territories combined their lands to form the Saldaer of the present, forming a ruling body of governors to run the newly born nation.<br><br>
            taking advantage of it's varied climate and access to countless exotic resources, Saldaer built a strong relationship with Tassalyr, and using the stone and precious crystals traded from the elven kingdom to build the now beloved trading capital of Nashonde to the North.<br><br>
            In the present day, Saldaer is governed by a council of nine, elected by the citizenry in order to keep the interests of the people at heart.
            </p>

        <h2>The Last Holy War</h2>

            <p>Optimistically named as such to discourage any future conflicts, the Last Holy War was instigated by the western nation of Alormyr.  The ruthless theocracy viewed Saldaer's apparent lack of faith in the gods as potential for evil to cultivate, and Alormyr saw it as their divine right to conquer Saldaer and bring the Light of the Sword to the Eastern nation.<br><br>
            Saldaer and Tassalyr joined forces to defend the freedom of their nations, eventually bringing Alormyr's expansion to a halt just before the Dry Sea, and bringing an end to the war in a legendary victory.<br><br>
            The victory came with a heavy cost, however. A famed councillor of Saldaer and Queen Aeloria of Tassalyr had been found dead in each other's arms. Long rumoured to have a secret relationship, their bond was tragically confirmed at the very end of their lives.<br><br>
            To commemorate the late rulers of the two nations, The inlet where Ashonde makes its home, and where the two nations join borders, was named "Lover's Quay."
            </p> 
    
        <h2>Faith</h2>

            <p>The Governing body of Saldaer sees faith in the gods as unnecessary.  As a nation that values the tenacity of their people, many tales are told of Saldans who make their own destiny and blaze their own paths in life.  Many citizens see the self-made origin of their country as a shining beacon of their ethos, and strive to follow his example in everyday life, finding success where they can out of whatever they can find.<br><br>
            Although the gods are widely seen as unnecessary, Saldaer does not outright ban the worship of deities in their lands.
            </p> 

        <h2>Relations</h2>

                <h3>Tassalyr</h3>
                    <p class="indentP">
                        The elves of Tassalyr established strong trade relations with Saldaer, exchanging their high quality stone and precious crystals for exotic spices, textiles, and precious metals. This strong bond between the two nations is further solidified by a tale of love between rulers.<br><br>
                        According to the tale, the Queen of Tassalyr and a famed councillor of Saldaer fell in love and tragically died in each other's arms during the Last Holy War, who was attempting to spread compulsory worship of their deity by force. The tale of their love and sacrifice has been passed down through generations, fostering a deep sense of mutual respect and cooperation. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Alormyr</h3>
                    <p class="indentP">
                        In the present day, Alormyr allows some trade concessions from Saldaer into their nation, but make any travel between the two nations difficult, barring entry for normal travellers unless highly restrictive travel permits are acquired.
                    </p>
                <h3>The Shrouded Coast</h3>
                    <p class="indentP">
                        To the southeast of Saldaer is the Shrouded Coast, a land of perpetual fog shielded by jagged mountains. It is a highly dangerous place, thought to be filled with aberrations and monsters. All who visit never return. To maintain a line of defense against the horrors of this land spewing forth into Saldaer, the nation installed a fort between the mountains.
