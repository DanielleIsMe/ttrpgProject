            <p><em>In the beautiful, forested valley at the northern end of the elven nation of Tassalyr lies the charming mining city of Frain. This picturesque city nestled in a lakeside valley, known for its rustic charm and timeless stone architecture woven with precious crystals, hides a sinister secret. People are vanishing without a trace, and disturbingly, those who remain have no memory of their missing neighbors. Abandoned houses filled with personal belongings; uneaten meals, half-written letters, and blurred photographs, stand as silent witnesses to lives abruptly erased. The townsfolk, unaware of the creeping curse, go about their daily routines, oblivious to the danger that lurks around them.<br><br>
            Concerned by the sudden and inexplicable cessation of communications between Frain and the capital city of Camais, a group of adventurers is dispatched to uncover the truth. As they delve deeper into the mystery, they encounter an unsettling atmosphere filled with fragmented memories, haunting whispers, and a looming sense of dread. Each discovery pulls them further into a nightmare where the line between reality and illusion blurs.</em></p>
