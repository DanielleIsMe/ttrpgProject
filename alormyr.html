        </div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>To the west of Saldaer lies the theocratic nation of Alormyr, ruled by religious zealots with an iron fist. Alormyr is known for its verdant landscapes, pleasant weather, and dense forests. This is contrasted by Alormyr's rule, imposing the study and worship of their faith to all who make their home there.  Its holy city lies at the edge of a vast forest, and the nation is often described as a land of natural beauty.<br><br>
            Alormyr is a stalwart bastion of faith, worshipping the deity Iomedae and imposing compulsory worship of all who reside in their religion.  Interpreting Saldaer's apparent lack of faith in the gods as potential for evil to cultivate, Alormyr saw it as their divine right to conquer Saldaer and bring the Light of the Sword to the Eastern nation, in a vicious campaign that was ultimately unsuccessful.<br><br>
            </p>

        <h2>The Last Holy War</h2>

            <p>Optimistically named as such to discourage any future conflicts, the Last Holy War was instigated by the western nation of Alormyr.  The ruthless theocracy viewed Saldaer's apparent lack of faith in the gods as potential for evil to cultivate, and Alormyr saw it as their divine right to conquer Saldaer and bring the Light of the Sword to the Eastern nation.<br><br>
            Saldaer and Tassalyr joined forces to defend the freedom of their nations, eventually bringing Alormyr's expansion to a halt just before the Dry Sea, and bringing an end to the war in a legendary victory.<br><br>
            The victory came with a heavy cost, however. A famed councillor of Saldaer and Queen Aeloria of Tassalyr had been found dead in each other's arms. Long rumoured to have a secret relationship, their bond was tragically confirmed at the very end of their lives.<br><br>
            To commemorate the late rulers of the two nations, The inlet where Ashonde makes its home, and where the two nations join borders, was named "Lover's Quay."
            </p> 
    
        <h2>Faith</h2>

            <p>The nation of Alormyr is a stalwart theocracy, renowned for their immovable faith in the Goddess Iomedae.  Alormyr interprets the Light of the Sword and her domains as the absolute truth  of the world, valuing Confidence in their faith, the Truth of their convictions, the Might of their nation and the Zeal of their knights in righteous battle above all else.  All citizens of Alormyr follow the faith of the Lady of Valor.
            </p> 

        <h2>Relations</h2>

                <h3>Tassalyr</h3>
                    <p class="indentP">
                        Tassalyr avoids interaction with Alormyr whenever possible due to previous tension between the two nations. The elves of Tassalyr view Alormyr's rigid theocracy with suspicion and caution, preferring to maintain their distance and focus on more open and cooperative relationships.
                    </p>
                <h3>Saldaer</h3>
                    <p class="indentP">
                        In the present day, Alormyr allows some trade concessions from Saldaer into their nation, but make any travel between the two nations difficult, barring entry for normal travellers unless highly restrictive travel permits are acquired.
