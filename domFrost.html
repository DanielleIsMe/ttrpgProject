        <h2>Ecology</h2>

            <p>The Dominion is beset by an eternal winter, a frozen waste suffering through heavy snowfall year round.  A mountain range extends along the border of Tassalyr, barring entry through all but one portion of the range.  A lonely collection of mountains sits to the far north, and is thought to host the nation's capital city.
            </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>To the far north of Catonor lies the mysterious Dominion of Frost, a land shrouded in eternal winter and seperated from Tassalyr by a jagged mountain range. Very little is known about this reclusive nation, only that it's ruler is an ancient white Dragon.<br><br>
            For as long as the elves have resided in Tassalyr, a great grey keep has barred entry through the mountains, refusing passage to any who wish to travel to the Dominion. This keep came to be known as Dragon's Shield, a bastion built to keep all who threaten their ruler out of its walls.

        <h2>Relations</h2>

                <h3>Tassalyr</h3>
                    <p class="indentP">
                        The relationship between Tassalyr and the Dominion of Frost has always been tense, primarily due to the refusal of trade and the Dominion's refusal to lend aid during a devastating civil war in Tassalyr<br><br>
                        The cold and snowy climate of Tassalyr, which becomes increasingly harsh and inhospitable as one travels north, only heightened the tensions. No love is lost between these two nations, and attempts by Tassalyr to communicate with the Dominion have only been met with silence.
